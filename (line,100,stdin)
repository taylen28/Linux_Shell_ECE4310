[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mfgetc[22m()  reads  the next character from [4mstream[24m and returns it as an [4munsigned[24m [4mchar[24m cast to an [4mint[24m, or [1mEOF [22mon end
       of file or error.

       [1mgetc[22m() is equivalent to [1mfgetc[22m() except that it may be implemented as a macro which evaluates [4mstream[24m  more  than
       once.

       [1mgetchar[22m() is equivalent to [1mgetc([4m[22mstdin[24m[1m)[22m.

       [1mfgets[22m()  reads  in at most one less than [4msize[24m characters from [4mstream[24m and stores them into the buffer pointed to
       by [4ms[24m.  Reading stops after an [1mEOF [22mor a newline.  If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer.  A  termi‐
       nating null byte ('\0') is stored after the last character in the buffer.

       [1mungetc[22m()  pushes [4mc[24m back to [4mstream[24m, cast to [4munsigned[24m [4mchar[24m, where it is available for subsequent read operations.
       Pushed-back characters will be returned in reverse order; only one pushback is guaranteed.

       Calls to the functions described here can be mixed with each other and with calls to other input functions from
       the [4mstdio[24m library for the same input stream.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mfgetc[22m(), [1mgetc[22m(), and [1mgetchar[22m() return the character read as an [4munsigned[24m [4mchar[24m cast to an [4mint[24m or [1mEOF  [22mon  end  of
       file or error.

       [1mfgets[22m() returns [4ms[24m on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurs while no characters have been read.

       [1mungetc[22m() returns [4mc[24m on success, or [1mEOF [22mon error.

       It  is not advisable to mix calls to input functions from the [4mstdio[24m library with low-level calls to [1mread[22m(2) for
       the file descriptor associated with the input stream; the results will be undefined and very probably not  what
       you want.
